## Introduction
Recently I came across a very interesting problem. One of my friends(read **Crush** :P) was given an assignment in her graphics class which required them to plot an ellipse without using any mathematical plotting libraries.
The problem seems easy at first but probably it is not. Since you cannot use any library, it is not an easy job to plot **Mr. Ellipse**.
And to make problems worse, turns out they needed to rotate the Ellipse as well, given some angle of rotation.

But it's my Crush nevertheless and no guy in the world would leave a chance to impress his crush I guess. Would you? I guess not. :P
So we decided to work on some solution together. Well we came up with more than one(She is a pretty smart one. Nice catch eh? :P)
